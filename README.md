This repo contains a Simulatte client implementation. It's in fact a game that comes with an embedded Simulatte server. The game communicates with the server, sends the user's input and the playground as a request and decodes the responses from server to obtain frames that will be animated by the game engine.

More features such as multimap loading and changing, and a store where you can buy items to be used in game, are added.

The game is developped with Unity and C#.
